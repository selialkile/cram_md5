  apachepassword  = CramMd5::apache_md5_crypt (password [, salt])

DESCRIPTION

  unix_md5_crypt() provides a crypt()-compatible interface to the
  rather old MD5-based crypt() function found in modern operating systems
  using old and solid libs.

  It's based on the implementation found on FreeBSD 2.2.[56]-RELEASE and
  contains the following license in it:
